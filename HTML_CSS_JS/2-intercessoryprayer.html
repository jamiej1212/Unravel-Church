    <p class="int-title">Matthew 18:19- 29<br><br></p>
    <p class="int-body">“Again I say to you that if two of you agree on earth concerning anything that they ask, it will be done for them by My Father in heaven.<br>
      For where two or three are gathered together in My name, I am there in the midst of them.”<br><br><br></p>
    
    <p class="int-title">1 Timothy 2: 1 -2<br><br></p>
    <p class="int-body">“Therefore, I exhort first of all that supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks be made for all men, for kings and all<br>
      who are in authority, that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life of all godliness and reverence.”<br><br><br></p>
    
    <p class="int-title">James 5:14-16<br><br></p>
    <p class="int-body">“Now this is the confidence that we have in Him, that if we ask anything according to HIs will, He hears us. And if we know that<br>
      He hears us, whatever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we have asked of Him.”<br><br><br></p>

    <p class="int-title">1 John 5: 14<br><br></p>
    <p class="int-body">“Is anyone among you suffering? Let him pray. Is anyone cheerful? Let him sing psalms. Is anyone among you sick? Let him call<br>
      for the elders of the church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord. And the prayer of faith will<br>
      save the sick, and the Lord will raise him up. And if he has committed sins, he will be forgiven. Confess your trespasses to<br>
      one another, and pray for one another, that you may be healed. The effective, fervent prayer of a righteous man avails much.”<br><br><br></p>
    
    <p class="int-title">John 9:31<br><br></p>
    <p class="int-body">“Now we know that God does not hear sinners; but if anyone is a worshiper of God and does He will, He hears him.”</p>
